# jQuery-slider
Functionality:
1. It detects how many pictures are loaded into HTML
2. It automatically displays the next slide after 5 seconds
3. On mouse over stops the animation and restarts it on mouse leave.
4. You also have control bullets that shows you on what slide you are.
5. The control bullets also allow you to jump to certain slide.

Note: I've added HTML + CSS template just to see more easily how it works.
